## Running your own instance:
### Step 0: Install Python 3.11.5
For Windows you can get the installer [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3115/#:~:text=Full%20Changelog-,files,-Version), for Linux you can search for your package manager's solution.<br>

You can check which version of python you're running with this command
```commandline
C:\> python --version
Python 3.11.5
```

### Step 1: Download Dependencies.
Download Python 3.11 and set it as your main interpreter in your code editor. To download dependencies, run this in your console:
```commandline
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This should install all dependencies needed to run the bot.

### Step 2: config.yaml
In `bot/data` there is file called `example_config.yaml` which has information for APIs and other sensitive information that should be included. You need to create a file in the same directory called `config.yaml` with the information filled.

### Step 3: Running the bot.
If everything is done right, the bot should run.
